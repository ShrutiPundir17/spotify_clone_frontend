# spotify_clone_frontend
This project is a Spotify Clone built using only HTML and CSS to mimic the layout and design of the popular music streaming platform, Spotify. The primary goal is to create a visually appealing web interface that resembles Spotifyâ€™s home page, featuring essential elements like navigation bars, album covers, playlists, and a music player section.
